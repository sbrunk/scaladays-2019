# Interactive Computing with Jupyter and Almond

Slides of my Scala Days 2019 talk [Interactive Computing with Jupyter and Almond](https://scaladays.org/schedule/interactive-computing-with-jupyter-and-almond) ([video](https://portal.klewel.com/watch/webcast/scala-days-2019/talk/48/).

The slides are a Jupyter notebook that you can [run interactively yourself using binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sbrunk/scaladays-2019/master?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fslides.ipynb)
